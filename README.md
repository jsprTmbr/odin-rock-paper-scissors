# odin-rock-paper-scissors

A JavaScript based project around the "Cult Classic" "Rock-Paper-Scissors".

Took about 2-3 hours non-stop. Again very minimal usage of google, mainly used it for the loops. However at one point had to use ChatGPT because i had a piece of code that wouldn't execute. Turned out it was because i had a return value that didn't let the rest of the code finish, so lesson learned.

Pleased that i don't need to use AI and google for everything JS anymore.
